      <p class="mt-2">At Storipod, our mission is to nurture an authentic, safe, and vibrant ecosystem for writers, readers, and storytellers.
      To achieve this, we are strengthening our policy framework to ensure that engagement across the platform remains genuine,
      voluntary, and free from manipulative tactics.</p>

      <p class="mt-2">Effective immediately, any activity that seeks to artificially inflate engagement metrics—such as comments or posts that
      repeatedly request or demand actions like “follow back,” “done,” “view my slide,” “view my profile,” “like and share,” or similar
      repetitive calls for engagement—will be classified as spamming behavior.</p>

      <p class="mt-2">Such activities undermine the trust and organic growth that Storipod strives to build for its creator community.</p>

      <p class="mt-4">Accounts that persistently engage in these practices may face the following actions without further notice:</p>

      <ol class="list-decimal mt-1 pl-4 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Content Moderation and Removal:</strong> Posts, comments, or messages that contain spam-like or coercive engagement
        tactics will be flagged and removed in accordance with our automated and manual content moderation protocols.</li>
        <li><strong>Account Restrictions:</strong> Repeated violations will result in progressive account restrictions, including but not limited to
        temporary posting bans, suspension of certain account features such as commenting or messaging, or full account suspensions for
        severe or repeated offenses.</li>
        <li><strong>Creators Earnings Eligibility:</strong> Accounts found to persistently violate this policy will lose eligibility to participate in
        Storipod’s creator earnings and monetization opportunities. Maintaining the integrity of the Creator Fund and other reward mechanisms
        is a top priority. Only accounts that comply fully with these guidelines will be eligible to earn.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>We believe genuine audience building should be based on the value of your work, authentic interactions, and community trust—
      not on forced reciprocation or spam tactics. This update aligns with global best practices for digital content platforms and helps us protect
      all users from misleading or low-quality engagement.</p>

      <p class="mt-2">By continuing to use Storipod, you agree to comply with this updated policy and all related terms of use.</p>

      <p class="mt-1">We encourage everyone to focus on producing meaningful stories, engaging in constructive conversations, and growing readership organically.</p>

      <h3 class="mt-6 mb-2 font-bold text-lg text-gray-800">How to earn from your creativity</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-4 mb-4">
        <li>Create consistently. Regular publishing of high-quality content keeps your audience engaged and your earnings growing.</li>
        <li>Share everywhere. Instagram, Twitter, WhatsApp, TikTok and beyond. Your stories deserve a wider audience.</li>
        <li>Build community. Invite friends and fellow creators. Every new reader multiplies your impact.</li>
        <li>Engage with readers. Respond to comments and build lasting connections with your audience.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="mt-6 mb-2 font-bold text-lg text-gray-800">How payouts work</h3>
      <p>Our payout system is automated. The specific earnings per view are not publicly disclosed at this time.
      Earnings depend on various factors including content quality, audience engagement, and consistency.</p>
      <p class="mt-1">Thank you for helping us uphold a safe and rewarding creative community.</p>
